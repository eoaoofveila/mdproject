### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The code is designed to implement a customer loyalty program for a small bookstore. It appears to involve video streaming and camera management, but further details are needed for a complete understanding.

### Code Structure <a name="code-structure"></a>

The code is written in C++ and includes libraries for OpenCV and FFmpeg. It is organized into several sections, including camera data, video buffering, mutex usage, and thread management.

### Data Structures <a name="data-structures"></a>

#### `struct cameradata`

- Stores camera parameters such as URL, username, password, and port.
- Includes a thread ID for system allocation.

#### `struct videobuffer`

- Represents a circular queue for storing video data (AVPacket).
- Maintains `front` and `rear` indices for data management.

#### `struct parameterpack`

- Used for passing parameters to decoding processes.
- Includes a process ID (`pid`), a stringstream pointer (`id`), a format context pointer (`fmtCtx`), and a video stream index (`videoStreamIndex`).

### Thread Management <a name="thread-management"></a>

The code manages multiple threads for camera activation, decoding, and more. Thread management includes activation flags, thread IDs, and signals.

### Camera Configuration <a name="camera-configuration"></a>

Camera configurations are stored in the `cameradata` struct, including URLs, usernames, passwords, and ports. The code appears to support multiple cameras.

### Mutex Usage <a name="mutex-usage"></a>

Mutexes (`std::mutex`) are used extensively to protect shared data between threads. Different mutexes are employed for different purposes, including protecting data between decoding and accessing processes.

### Program Signals <a name="program-signals"></a>

Various signals and flags are used throughout the program to manage thread activation, data availability, and process termination.

### Camera Activation <a name="camera-activation"></a>

# `cameradd` Function Documentation

This documentation explains the `cameradd` function, which is responsible for adding cameras to the program during runtime. The function accepts camera data, the number of cameras to add, and whether it should be blocked.

## Function Signature

```cpp
void cameradd(struct cameradata* carema, int number, int isblocked);
